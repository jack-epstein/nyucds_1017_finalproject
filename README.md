# nyucds_1017_finalproject

This is the final report of my team's NYU Responsible Data Science Project. "[Pedro Galarza]" (https://github.com/pedroglrz) and I each contributed significant amounts to all notebooks in the repo. The project is a fairness and transparency analysis of an automated decision system (ADS) built on Kaggle to predict heart disease. 

The final PDF is shared here https://github.com/jack-epstein/nyucds_1017_finalproject/blob/main/RDS_1017_FinalWriteUp.pdf <br>
