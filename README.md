# nyucds_1017_finalproject

This is the final report of my team's NYU Responsible Data Science Project. [Pedro Galarza](https://github.com/pedroglrz) and I each contributed significant amounts to all notebooks in the repo. In the project we explore the implementation of an automated decision system (ADS) on Kaggle and evaluate this system for it's fairness and transparency.
